                        Frosty was a soft and loving gentle giant of a cat and probably one of the orange cats that had a braincell constantly. He loved pets and joined the girls shortly after Millie was brought in.  He passed away after consuming rat poison and then being hit by car soon after.

                    Fuzzlord was originally called Cookie when he was first born. He was from the same farm as Pocket. He was a mischievous kitten who followed everyone around.  When he was about a year old, his behavior quickly shifted into being highly aggressive and unpredictable. He bit a person which sent them to the hospital with a nasty infection and was put down soon after. It is believed this was genetic as his father and brother behaved similarly.

                    Dusty is a rowdy cat who loves to spend his time both inside and outside. When indoors he tries to play with Lizzie and when outdoors he practices his hunting skills. He’s deathly afraid of anything with an active engine or Fae.  His is highly playful and has fun with nearly any toy, bag, or whatever he thinks is a plaything.
