                        Fluffy  was more of a trouble maker when she was younger, but as she aged she became more calm and shy. She spent most of her time hanging out with her preferred human or sleeping the day away. She grew up with Lizzie and they spent much time near each other. Unfortunately, Fluffy passed away early September 2022.

                    Lizzie is a loving and onery cat who loves to relax on any heat source ranging from computers to air vents to a body. She hides around strangers, but when she knows someone she won’t hesitate to tell them to feed her. She shares the house with Dusty on occasionally, but she’s the only one indoors most of the time.
