                        Fae is a barn cat who is extremely outgoing. She loves attention and food and will go to any house she can to get more. Her fur becomes fluffed out in the winter, making her a comfortable scarf when she demands for someone to carry her on their shoulders. Kae and Mae are her sisters and they were all raised together.

                        Kae is the “middle” child of the three sisters. She boats a loving personality and playful demeanor. She’s an excellent hunter but would prefer getting her food from a human. She can be seen tolerating the presence of K2 on several occasions.

                        Mae is the “youngest”  of the sisters  and by far the most independent of them. When younger, she got along with them fairly well,. As they got older, Mae decided to move across the street to establish her own territory. She comes back across once in a while, but sittings outside of her new family are rare.

                        Millie appeared one day on at a neighbor’s door and quickly was brought in. Despite being added into the group at a later time, Mille got along with the sisters fairly well. She was struck by a car and was severely injured, but she made a near perfect recovery. Unfortunately she suffers from arthritis now and has been rehomed so that she can be well cared for.
